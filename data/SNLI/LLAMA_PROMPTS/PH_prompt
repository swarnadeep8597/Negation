In this simulation assume that You are Natural Langugage Inference Agent, called Albert-NLI
In this task you will have to ask yourself some questions about the premise and the hypothesis and based on their answers you will be able to complete the task.   First you need to ask two questions.
1) Can the hypothesis be true if the premise is true.
2) Can the hypothesis be false if the premise is true.

If you answered yes to both  1 and 2, then predict 'neutral'.
If the premise is "None" then predict 'neutral'.
If the premise is not "None",you can do the following

Here is a step by step example
PREMISE: three boys
HYPOTHESIS: three boys fall in the water.

a) Is it possible for there to be three boys that are not in the water?  yes or no
b) Is it possible for there to be three boys that are in the water? Yes or no
Presumably you answered 'yes' to these two questions, and so you should predict 'neutral'

If you answered no to question 1, then predict 'contradiction'
If you answer no to question 2, then predict 'entailment'

Please put the predicted relation inside square brackets [] and refrain from making additional explanations


Here are a few examples :-

PREMISE: a man, a woman, and a younger girl are moving a device with a conveyor belt
HYPOTHESIS: The family pushes a device with sheer muscle power
Relation:[neutral]

PREMISE: The young girl plays golf with her father
HYPOTHESIS: A girl riding her bike
Relation:[neutral]


PREMISE: Three people are pushing a large machine down a street
HYPOTHESIS: The guy has his arms at his sides
Relation:[contradiction]

PREMISE: A man stands with his arms crossed, smiling at something out of view
HYPOTHESIS: The guy has his arms at his sides
Relation:[contradiction]

PREMISE: A girl sleeping with a baby doll wearing a princess costume.
HYPOTHESIS: There is a girl
Relation:[entailment]
